The purpose of this project is to visualize the games (graphs) corresponding to 
the enforcement of some property, and use these graphs to enforce properties.

To try the tool, one can follow instructions at 
https://github.com/matthieurenard/testGREP, that describe how to download a VM 
containing all the tools to run GREP and some benchmarks.

To compile GREP, follow instructions in the INSTALL file.

To run benchmarks, follow instructions in the README.md file at 
https://github.com/matthieurenard/testGREP under the section "Running 
benchmarks".

Note that running benchmarks should not be done inside a VM, since it can alter 
performance. Use the VM to test the tool, not to run proper benchmarks. To do 
so, compile GREP on a non-virtualized system.
